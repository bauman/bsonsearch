 bsoncompare links against libpcre (BSD licensed) to perform regex operations

 (http://www.pcre.org/licence.txt --retreived April 29, 2016)

 PCRE2 LICENCE
 -------------

 PCRE2 is a library of functions to support regular expressions whose syntax
 and semantics are as close as possible to those of the Perl 5 language.

 Release 10 of PCRE2 is distributed under the terms of the "BSD" licence, as
 specified below. The documentation for PCRE2, supplied in the "doc"
 directory, is distributed under the same terms as the software itself. The data
 in the testdata directory is not copyrighted and is in the public domain.

 The basic library functions are written in C and are freestanding. Also
 included in the distribution is a just-in-time compiler that can be used to
 optimize pattern matching. This is an optional feature that can be omitted when
 the library is built.
